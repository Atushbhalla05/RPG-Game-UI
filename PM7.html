			<p>The prototype is designed using a Modle View View Modle architeture. The model of the inventory
			uses a map with the key being the category name and the value being an array of the class Item. 
			the Item class consist of a name and a breff discription for now, latter on the class will be expanded
			with the name of a imgage file that will be use for the icons for the item. The view is all the elements
			the user see on the interface (index.html). Each element on the interface will has an event listener 
			that will wait for the user to interact with it. On the action, the model will change depending on what
			the user interacted with. The arrays are limited to indexes 0-29, the 30th index is use to keep the track
			of what the user has equiped.

                <p>The design is based on an MMORPG game, because of this we thought that the design should be simple and compact
				allowing users to see what is going on in-game while interacting with the inventory interface. Also because MMORPG
				games has massive range of items that user can pick up we thought that it might be a good idea to have each item 
				be separated in different files and each icon be stored in a separate directory from the item files. We this ideal
				was constant while developing our interface. We did not implement this as part of the design because we see the organization
				of in-game assets as part of the overall game development and not just the inventory development. In our design we have
				a section of the selected element is ment to show user a short discription and stat of a particular item. In the prototype
				we did not include stat for any particular items in the inventory. In an actual MMORPG the stats are diverse and can be 
				complicated for this reason we did not include stats for our inventory interface as the stats would be included in the
				item file with the discription of the item. We did not see the need to add in possitive changes to stats when comparing 
				items in the inventory as each item can have differnt stat that can change how the user play the game. In the original design
				we intended to change the selected category icon in a way that would help user see what category they were on, however we did 
				not implement it in the prototype because throught the multiple trials whe conducted, the major of user did not have a problem 
				with recornizing the category they were on.

                <p>The most significant change that we could've made would have to be the placement of the current equiped and selected item elemet
				of the design. We feel like by changing the placement of the elements could potentually affect how efficient the user could complet
				the task. An example would be the having the elements close to where the selected item was and alinging the elements next to one 
				another. This way the user does not have to travel far to complet the task and their eyes would follow the changes more naturally.
				This will required some testing to compair the efficy of each placement to see if it has some significant impact on how fast the 
				user could complet the task. We think the project was not very difficult, but the development process was very slow, with each
				changes that we want to make and new feature to add we had to consider if the restrain allows us to do so. The most helpful design
				decision and most important decision was if a particular implementation should be made by the design team or the development. We basicly
				ask our self if we really have to implement this as part of the design or if this was part of a larger developing process. Because of 
				this our final prototype looks still look like a work in progress. When designing this project we think of our self as part of larger
				group devloping an idea. The design is only a small part of the overall idea so if we shut out all other factor and only focus on
				making our part in a way that would complement the larger idea. We think that it is best to separate what could be done and what should 
				be done because the different between then could be very large and could cause unnessicary bugs.
